# LTL-Transfer

This work shows ways to reuse policies trained to solve a set of training tasks, specified by linear temporal logic (LTL), to solve novel LTL tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Please see the following paper for more details.

## Installation instructions

You might clone this repository by running:

    git clone https://github.com/jasonxyliu/ltl_transfer.git

Training state-centric policies with LPOPL requires [Python3.5](https://www.python.org/) with three libraries: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [sympy](http://www.sympy.org).
Python 3.7 should also work.

Transfer Learning requires [dill](https://dill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) if use on a cluster.

Visualization requires [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

Install all dependencies in a conda environment by running the following command

    conda create -n ltl_transfer python=3.7 numpy sympy dill networkx matplotlib pillow tensorflow=1  # tensorflow 1.15

## Running examples
Navigation into *src* folder then run *run_experiments.py*.

To run LPOPL to learn state-centric policies

    python3 run_experiments.py --algo=lpopl --train_type=mixed --train_size=50 --map=0

To run zero-shot transfer on a local machine

    python run_experiments.py --algo=zero_shot_transfer --train_type=mixed --train_size=50 --test_type=soft --map=0 --relabel_method=local

Reduce ```RELABEL_CHUNK_SIZE``` to 21 in ``zero_shot_transfer.py`` if run the above Python script slows down your machine too much. It controls how many parallel processes are running at a time.

To run zero-shot transfer on a cluster

    python run_experiments.py --algo=zero_shot_transfer --train_type=mixed --train_size=50 --test_type=soft --map=0 --relabel_method=cluster


## Running examples (old instructions from [LPOPL repo](https://bitbucket.org/RToroIcarte/lpopl/src/master/) )

To run LPOPL and our three baselines, move to the *src* folder and execute *run_experiments.py*. This code receives 3 parameters: The RL algorithm to use (which might be "dqn-l", "hrl-e", "hrl-l", or "lpopl"), the tasks to solve (which might be "sequence", "interleaving", "safety"), and the map (which is an integer between -1 and 9). Maps 0 to 4 were randomly generated. Maps 5 to 9 are adversarial maps. Select '--map=-1' to run experiments over the 10 maps with three trials per map. For instance, the following command solves the 10 *sequence tasks* over map 0 using LPOPL:

    python3 run_experiments.py --algo=lpopl --train_type=sequence --map=0

The results will be printed and saved in './tmp'. After running LPOPL over all the maps, you might run *test_util.py* (which also receives the algorithm and task parameters) to compute the average performance across the 10 maps:

    python3 test_utils.py --algo=lpopl --train_type=sequence

The overall results will be saved in the './results' folder.


## Visualization

To visualize initiation set classifiers

    python visualize_classifiers.py --algo=lpopl --tasks_id=4 --map_id=0 --ltl_id=12 --simple_vis
    

## Generating new random maps

You might generate new random maps using the code in *src/map_generator.py*. The only parameter required is the random seed to be used. The resulting map will be displayed in the console along with the number of steps that an optimal policy would need to solve the "sequence", "interleaving", and "safety" tasks (this value is computed using value iteration and might take a few minutes):

    python3 map_generator.py --create_map --seed=0

It is also possible to automatically look for adversarial maps for the Hierarchical RL baseline. To do so, we generate *num_eval_maps* random maps and rank them according to the difference between the reward obtained by an optimal policy and the reward obtained by an optimal myopic policy. The code will display the random seeds of the top *num_adv_maps* ranked maps. (You might then display those maps using theÂ *--create_map* flag.)

    python3 map_generator.py --adversarial --num_adv_maps=5 --num_eval_maps=1000
